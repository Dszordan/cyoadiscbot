campaign_definition:
  description: Each month in the isolated city of Theraii, an uncompromising dragon
    demands an increasingly larger and larger human sacrifice, a task burdening the
    conflicted Mayor Lord Seville. The Church of Eternity worships the dragon and
    reigns in the population, for their sacrifice leads to eternal peace. Seville
    finds himself torn between corrupt church, an undercurrent of dissent within the
    populace and the looming threat of missing quota to an oppressive ancient dragon.
